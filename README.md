OpenCV Projects

This repository contains multiple Python scripts utilizing OpenCV for camera-based applications. Each script performs a different function, showcasing the versatility of OpenCV. The code was developed with the help of tutorials from the Tech with Tim (https://www.youtube.com/c/TechWithTim) YouTube channel.

1. Camera and Video Capture :

This script opens the laptop camera and displays the live video feed. It serves as the base functionality for camera operations.

2. Color Transformation :

This script opens the camera feed but modifies the colors of the captured video. It applies basic color transformations to demonstrate image manipulation techniques in OpenCV.

3. Multi-View Display :

This script splits the camera feed into four separate windows, displaying different views simultaneously. It's a useful example of how to handle multiple views or perspectives within a single frame.

4. Face and Eye Detection :

In this script, the camera feed is enhanced with face and eye detection. OpenCV's Haar Cascades are used to detect faces and eyes in real-time from the video feed.

5. Installation :

To run these scripts, you'll need to install the following dependencies:

pip install opencv-python

pip install numpy

6. Usage :

Simply run each script in your Python environment. For example:

python CameraAndVideoCapture.py

Each script can be executed individually, and you'll need a camera connected to your system.

7. Credits :

These scripts were created with the guidance of the Tech with Tim (https://www.youtube.com/c/TechWithTim) YouTube tutorials.
